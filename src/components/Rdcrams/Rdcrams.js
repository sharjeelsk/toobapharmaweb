            TPPL can perform discovery and process chemistry through services that range from synthetic route identification and optimization to synthesis of niche building blocks, scaffolds and intermediate compounds for generating analogs.
            <br /><br />Another area of focus for TPPL is the custom synthesis of pre-clinical and clinical compounds on a multi-gram to multi-kilo scale.
            <br /><br />This service offering is related to developing commercially viable and competitive alternate routes to manufacture niche intermediates or APIs that involve multi-step manufacturing processes. The objectives of process optimization services are to significantly reduce the costs and the complexity in manufacturing process while avoiding unwanted bye-products in order to minimize waste and related environmental impact.
            <br /><br />TPPL can also perform contract or toll manufacturing of specific intermediates or APIs for in-market products and for NCEs from early phase development to commercialization stage.
