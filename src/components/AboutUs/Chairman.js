Chairman
With the founding of Tooba Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, I too embarked on a journey. A journey in which I endeavor to convert intellectual capital into products that enhance the quality of life and human well-being. As a scientist in the exciting world of pharmaceuticals, my journey and endeavors have been most fulfilling.
<br />
My long association with this industry, the experience I owe to my mentors, colleagues and well wishers, drive the spirit of innovation, entrepreneurship and ethics that we at Tooba have committed ourselves to.
<br />
While Tooba manufactures API bulk drugs & intermediates, our research orientation will continue with newer technologies like biocatalyses and metal catalyses, etc. for the development of generics, without losing sight of environment friendliness. Additionally we will pursue drug discovery with new chemical entities (NCEs) and projects will be worked out optimistically to cut short the duration of development period as well as commercially tailored expenditures. We will also provide our technological expertise and resources for third party custom research initiatives.
<br />
At Tooba, we shall continue to shape and evolve our business practices to best motivate our employees, customers, suppliers and all stakeholders. This I hold to be key in our effort to deliver excellence, as excellence, I believe should be the norm, rather than an exception, in the pharma industry.
